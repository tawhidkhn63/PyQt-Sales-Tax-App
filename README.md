# PyQt-Sales-Tax-App

The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a python based web app that uses PyQt5 to design the graphic user interface. The idea for this project came from https://www.pythonforengineers.com/your-first-gui-app-with-python-and-pyqt/ but I want to modify and improve the base app.
